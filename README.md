## Project Information
*An implementation of the board game "Mastermind"*
*So far what we have done is an implementation of the game
"Mastermind" in a single-player form with two files called 
CodeSequence and MasterMind. Other Files we have created
so far are three UML Diagrams and two test files for both
main files. What we have not done is finish the test 
methods and create the networking part to allow a 
multiplayer option for the game.*
## How to run it
*In order to play the game, you will need to run the main
method in the MasterMind file which will open up the
console on the bottom in order for you to try to guess the 
code solution.*
