## Project Information
We have done an implementation of the game
"Mastermind" in a single-player form with two files called 
CodeSequence and MasterMind. Other Files include three UML Diagrams and two test files for both
main programs.
## How to run it
*In order to play the game, run the main
method in the MasterMind file which will open up the
console on the bottom in order for you to try to guess the 
code solution.*
